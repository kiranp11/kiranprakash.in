+ [What We Talk About When We Talk About Data Products - Data Mesh Live, June 2025](https://2025.datameshlive.com/program/what-we-talk-about-when-we-talk-about-data-products/)
  
  This talk explores a tried-and-tested approach to designing, implementing, and governing data products.
  
  Since data mesh emerged half a decade ago, many organizations have embraced its vision but encountered challenges putting it into practice. The session provides practical guidance to help organizations start effectively.
  
  Emphasizing the concept of data products as the architectural quantum of the data mesh, the talk clarifies what data products areâ€”and what they aren't. It demonstrates how to design data products by working backward from use cases, ensuring they deliver tangible value. Key implementation patterns that have proven effective and adaptable across various contexts are presented. Additionally, the session introduces a unique governance method employing fitness functions, ensuring data products remain aligned with organizational needs over time.
  
  Intended for technical data leaders, attendees leave with actionable insights and strategies for implementing data products.
