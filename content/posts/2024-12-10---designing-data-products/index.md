Working backwards from the end goal is a core principle of software development, and we've found it to be highly effective in modelling data products. In this article we'll explore a step-by-step, methodical approach to identifying data products that avoids overdesign while providing just enough clarity for teams to begin implementation. Starting with a use case, we work backward to define data products and establish their boundaries. By overlaying additional use cases, we generalise the data products to prevent overfitting. Finally, we assign domain ownership and define service level objectives to guide the architecture and implementation.
