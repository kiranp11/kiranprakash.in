Decentralized data management requires automation to scale governance effectively. Fitness functions are a powerful automated governance technique we've applied to data products within the context of a Data Mesh. Since data products serve as the foundational building blocks (architectural quanta) of a data mesh, ensuring robust governance around them significantly increases the chances of a successful data mesh transformation. In this article, we'll explore how to implement this technique. We'll start by designing simple tests to assess key architectural characteristics of a data product, and then we'll explore how to automate their execution by leveraging metadata about the data products.
